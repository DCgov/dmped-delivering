<h1>Roots to Roofs</h1>

<p>As you know, we have three jobs in the mission of our agency: increase tax revenue, develop affordable housing and create jobs for DC residents. With that, this administration has been laser-focused on affordable housing…building it…preserving it…and now we are more focused than ever on making sure DC’s affordable housing is up to the standards of our city.</p>

<p>Mayor Bowser has gotten nearly a third of a billion dollars from our Housing Production Trust Fund out the door to do just that. And in Fiscal Year 17 alone, <b>96 percent</b> of Housing Production Trust Fund dollars went to projects serving families earning less than <b>$66,000</b> a year. Since 2015, we have delivered more than <b>5,300</b> units of affordable housing…and over the next five years we plan to deliver at least another <b>10,000</b>.</p>

<p>And with our new <a href="http://www.rootstoroofsdc.com/">Roots to Roofs</a> initiative, we are celebrating residents who proudly have put their roots down here for generations – or want to in the future. As we grow our economy, we want to ensure that every resident—regardless of color, background, or zip code—can live in Washington, DC. To this end, Mayor Bowser has made historic investments in affordable housing, homeownership programs and housing preservation. We have also enhanced homeownership programs like Open Doors and the Home Purchase Assistance Program and auctioned off vacant properties to make way for more affordable workforce housing. In sum, we are using every funding source and tool available to make sure you can continue to call DC your home. </p>

<p>Let's continue to put a roof on it - and keep an eye out for DHCD's June Housing Bloom!</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Deputy Mayor Brian T. Kenner</p>
