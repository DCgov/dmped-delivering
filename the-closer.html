<h1>Back to Basics: Economic Development Style</h1>

<p>In June, Mayor Bowser kicked off <b>"Back to Basics DC,"</b> a two-week effort highlighting the day-to-day work that keeps our city going. Every day, thousands of government employees and community members work behind the scenes to keep Washington, D.C. running – from tree watering to trash collection.</p>

<p>The Mayor’s “Back to the Basics” approach got me thinking about what this means for DMPED. Many of you have heard me say that the Mayor gave me three jobs: increase tax revenue, develop affordable housing and create jobs for D.C. residents – and that’s what getting back to the basics will mean for DMPED: how can we do more in those three areas to advance the District’s economic development to benefit <b>every</b> District resident.  </p>

<p>The numbers are on our side … we welcome nearly 1,000 new residents every month, Washington, D.C. is ranked in the top three strongest economies in the U.S. and top five places to live in the country. But the story of DC’s prosperity is to ensure every resident can benefit from our robust economy.  Along with my team, I will be doubling down on my “three jobs” and getting back to the basics of continuing to support a thriving Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Deputy Mayor Brian T. Kenner</p>
