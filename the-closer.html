<h2>A Busy and Inclusive March for DMPED</h2>

<p>March wasn't just madness for basketball fans in the District, but also jam packed with activity for the District's economic development community.</p>

<p>It started in early March when I joined Mayor Muriel Bowser in announcing our new <b>Economic Strategy</b> for the District. It is the framework for accelerating our progress as a leader for inclusive prosperity and creating opportunities that are accessible to all. It’s bold. It’s big. And the District is positioned to achieve it.</p>

<p>Then we headed to SXSW in mid-March to bring the best of Washington to Austin to tell the story of why DC is the <b>“Capital of Inclusive Innovation."</b> The District got national attention for its growing tech and entrepreneurship ecosystem and talents in arts, entertainment and business. </p>


<p>We followed SXSW with our third annual <b>DMPED March Madness</b>, our annual pre-solicitation event. This year, more than 20 development opportunities were announced by DMPED and other agencies to a standing room only crowd. We couldn't be more excited about your interest in continuing to develop Washington, D.C. </p>

<p>The month ended with the Mayor's exciting <b>State of the District Address</b> where we got our marching orders to keep on "delivering" for District residents by creating jobs, increasing tax revenue and developing affordable housing. We heard you Mayor Bowser and are even more committed than ever to serving District residents. </p>

<p>Deputy Mayor Brian T. Kenner</p>
