<h1>Seasons Are Changing, As Is DC</h1>

<p>August is what some people might call the “Sunday of Summer” – a cue to the end of a season. For DMPED, August is not the end of a season, but the beginning of one filled with lots of exciting things to look forward to in the District of Columbia.</p>

<p>In particular, September to us means <b>“202Creates”</b>– a month-long celebration of the District’s creative economy. During 202Creates, we’re excited to support thousands of events across the city -- in concert with our public and private partners -- that will showcase the District’s creativity></p>

<p>The District is the home of approximately <b>2,400 arts-related businesses</b> that employ almost <b>120,000 people, with 1,800 new jobs added last year</b>; with an array of entrepreneurs and dedicated professionals in television, film, music, arts, fashion, cosmetology, culinary, tech, and many more. I invite you to join us for 202Creates by checking the calendar of events <a href = "http://www.202creates.com/">here.</a></p>

<p>Later in September, we will be joining our Walter Reed team for a DCI/LAMB School ribbon-cutting event, a momentous occasion as they are the first non-military institution on the historic Walter Reed campus, where approximately <b>800 DCI students</b> and <b>200 LAMB PCS students</b> are currently enrolled.</p>

<p>In October, we will announce our fall legislative agenda, developer selections for projects and the progress we’ve made on the <b>District’s Economic Strategy</b>. All of these things, and more, are directly related to our responsibility to bring more jobs, tax revenue and affordable housing to the District.</p>

<p>I could go on and on previewing what is coming this fall, but for now, you will have to just stay tuned and make plans to join us along the way.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Brian T. Kenner</p>
