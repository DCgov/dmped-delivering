<h2>Third Annual innoMAYtion is here!</h2>

<p>Universally, spring is a time for renewal, growth and positive change. Here in the District, we embody these traits through a month-long initiative <b>“innoMAYtion</b>,” which focuses on the bold and unique ideas advancing DC as a <b>global center for innovation</b>. </p>

<p>We got a head start in late April with the opening of the nation’s first public-private <b>Inclusive Innovation Incubator</b> (In3). The In3 is the District's first affordable co-working incubator focused on diversity and inclusion. In partnership with Howard University and Luma Labs, it will support entrepreneurs and businesses from underrepresented communities (women, people of color, disabled, etc.) but also any entrepreneur who has a product and service benefiting underrepresented communities.  </p>

<p>Throughout the month, we will hold events and make announcements showcasing how ideas from local entrepreneurs and innovators are impacting our innovation ecosystem.</p>


<p>But #innoMAYtion is also about <b>you</b>.</p>

<p>I want to hear your voice and thoughts on what new approaches we can take to solve challenges and create opportunities. I invite you to come out to innoMAYtion events <a href ="http://inno.bcodev.net/event-list/">(see calendar here)</a> and <a href="mailto:innoMAYtion@dc.gov">email</a> us with your ideas.</p>

<p>At DMPED, we work every day <b>to strengthen, showcase, and support DC’s innovative community</b>, and we look forward to shining a light on our city’s “innoMAYtors” this month. Join us Thursday, May 4 for the innoMAYtion <a href="http://inno.bcodev.net/event/innomaytion-kickoff-party/">kick-off party</a> at Carnegie Library from 6-9 p.m. – be a part of innoMAYtion! </p>
