<h1>DMPED Delivered: The Wharf</h1>

<p>When Amazon announced that it was looking to open a second headquarters, my team at DMPED had one thought: “Obviously, DC.”</p>

<p>The opportunity to bring <b><u>Amazon</u></b>—and the <b>50,000</b> jobs that will come with it—to Washington, DC is an exciting one for us. We worked with the Mayor to present a world-class proposal to Amazon demonstrating why our top-tier talent, economic stability, diverse and vibrant neighborhoods, and culturally-rich city is the choice for Amazon. See the <a href="https://www.obviouslydc.com/sites">site options</a> and more on why Amazon should chose DC at <a href="https://www.obviouslydc.com/">obviouslydc.com</a>. Amazon is expected to narrow down its list of potential cities by the end of the year and make a decision next year.</p>

<p>While preparing our Amazon bid, we took a very important break to celebrate a District milestone: <b>the grand opening of The Wharf</b>. I had the honor of joining our Mayor, Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes-Norton, Councilmember Charles Allen (Ward 6) and Wharf developers Monty Hoffman and Amer Hammour to officially open the Wharf at the new Southwest Waterfront on Oct. 12.  A decade in the making, the Wharf is DC’s newest destination bringing with it the three things I’ve been charged by the Mayor to deliver:  <b>jobs, affordable housing and tax revenue</b> for the District. I can’t wait for everyone to enjoy all the Wharf has to offer.</p>

<p>We’ve got so much momentum going into November and expect big announcements from us on the legislative front. We are introducing <b>seven pieces of legislation</b> in the coming month – all movement forward on bringing more economic development in the District.</p>

<p>Thank you for being part of a memorable and exciting October. </p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Brian T. Kenner</p>
