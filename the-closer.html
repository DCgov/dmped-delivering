<h1>We Are THE Sports Capital!</h1>

<p>July is a month for sports in the District - the "Sports Capital" is staying true to its title this year. Not only are our sporting teams unifying the community, creating jobs and adding economic value to our city - they are showing up and performing!</p>

<p>We kicked off June with the Washington “#ALLCAPS” Capitals <a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/sports/NHL-Stanley-Cup-Takes-Washington_-D_C__Washington-DC-417719183.html">winning the Stanley Cup</a> – the first DC title since 2004...</p>

<p>And right as the World Cup is in full swing, DC United’s Audi Field in Buzzard Point is <a href="http://www.fox5dc.com/sports/audi-field-exclusive-look-at-dc-uniteds-name-stadium">officially opening</a> on July 14th…Audi Field will revitalize an often overlooked, but valuable area of DC; it will support development on both sides of the Anacostia River; and it will spur more than $1 billion in economic activity.</p>

<p>AND the Washington Nationals in Washington, DC are welcoming fans from across the globe for the <a href="https://www.mlb.com/nationals/tickets/all-star-week">MLB All-Star game</a> on July 17th at Nationals Park!</p>

<p>People think we are just the nation’s capital, but we are also the sports capital! Enjoy this month and Vamos United!</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Deputy Mayor Brian T. Kenner</p>
