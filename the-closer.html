<h1>Beyond DC's "Firsts" in Development</h1>

<p>Earlier this month, I joined the District’s building professionals including contractors, architects and developers at the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs (DCRA) “Build it in DC,”  a large forum about development and building opportunities in DC. </p>

<p>I had the pleasure of being on a panel discussion “Building the Future of DC,” where I was asked an interesting question: <b>“What is missing in the development plans of DC, and what are my hopes as the city grows?”</b></p>

<p>You’d think in a city where there is 152+ million square feet of development in the pipeline, I might say there is not much missing. But what is interesting about the future of development in DC is that it’s not about what’s <b>missing</b> – it’s about where it is <b>needed</b>.</p>

<p>We are past getting our “firsts” in the city – we have national brands like Costco and Target, and expanding homegrown businesses such as Busboys and Poets and Compass Coffee. But now that we have it, we are strategically focused on putting development and economic opportunity where it is needed in the District. </p>

<p>My hope for the future of development – and my responsibility as your deputy mayor – is to bring jobs, tax revenue and affordable housing to <b>all</b> eight wards in the District.</p>

<p>I look forward to continuing to work with all of you to make it happen and “build it in DC.”</p>

<p>Best,</p>

<p>Deputy Mayor Brian T. Kenner</p>
