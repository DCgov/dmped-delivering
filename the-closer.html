<h2>Innovation Today, Housing Tomorrow</h2>

<p>Wow, what a May! Thanks to everyone who made Mayor Bowser’s <b>third annual innoMAYtion</b> one for the record books. </p>

<p>Across the city, hundreds of you engaged in <b>over 50 events last month</b> and proved why DC is the capital of inclusive innovation. </p>

<p>The spirit of innoMAYtion will continue next week when the <b><a href = "http://www.politico.com/video/2017/06/07/full-playbook-university-video-dc-mayor-bowser-063307">Mayor joins Politico and Playbook University</a></b> at the Inclusive Innovation Incubator for a discussion on how Washington, DC is leading the way in technology and innovation inclusion.</p>

<p>As we move into summer this week, we turn our attention towards affordable housing, one of the cornerstones of my office.</p>

<p><b>“June Housing Bloom”</b> as we call it, is a month where we join DC housing agencies to provide resources and education on every facet of housing from affordable housing, renting, buying, and community development, culminating in the <b>9th annual Department of Housing and Community Development’s Housing Expo</b> on June 24 at the Convention Center.</p>

<p>I encourage you to join us throughout the month as we address the challenges and opportunities on affordable housing to ensure residents of all backgrounds can afford to live and thrive in this great city.</p>

<p>Deputy Mayor Brian T. Kenner</p>
