<p>(Washington, DC) – Today, Mayor Muriel Bowser was joined by Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) Brian T. Kenner to reveal over 20 projects now available to Washington, DC’s development community. The announcement came at DMPED’s March Madness, an annual effort to create more quality affordable housing, support small and local business, and expand job opportunities for DC residents.</p>

<p>“Continued development means jobs and housing. That is consistent with our push for inclusive prosperity, which starts with ensuring every DC resident has access to safe and affordable housing, a good paying job, and opportunities to share in our continued economic growth,” said Mayor Bowser. “Over the past two years, we have worked to create unprecedented levels of engagement and transparency. By using tools like OurRFP, we are putting residents on the front end of deciding the future of their neighborhoods, and with events like March Madness, we are forecasting our development opportunities for residents, nonprofits and business owners so all have an opportunity to participate.”</p>


<p>The Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development announced three new projects available for development, including two from the <a href="http://dcnewcommunities.org/">New Communities Initiative </a>and one using the <a href="https://dmped.dc.gov/page/our-rfp"> OurRFP</a> initiative:</p>

<p><ul><li>Northwest One, 2 Patterson Street (Ward 6) – New Communities Initiative</li>
<li>Lincoln Heights/Richardson Dwellings Master Developer (Ward 7) – New Communities Initiative</li>
<li>Eastern Branch Boys and Girls Club (Ward 6) – OurRFP</li></ul></p>

<p>“March Madness projects spur inclusive prosperity to more corners of the District. I look forward to working with residents, agency partners, local and small business, and the development community to ensure these future developments deliver for DC residents and neighborhoods,” said Deputy Mayor Kenner.</p>

<p>Mayor Bowser and Deputy Mayor Kenner were joined by the Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD), Deputy Mayor for Education (DME), Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR), Department of General Services (DGS), the Office of Public-Private Partnerships (OP3), Department of Small and Local Business Development (DSLBD), and the Office of Planning (OP) to announce new development and economic opportunities across all eight wards.</p>

<p>(Detailed information on each development opportunity can be found at dmped.dc.gov.)</p>

<!-- <p>The District will need to find jobs in the next five years for 1,313 residents of Wards 7 and 8 to reduce unemployment to below 10 percent in all eight wards. Bowser’s plan also calls for reducing to below 10 percent the rate of unemployment among high school graduates, currently 15.6 percent, and among African American residents, which is 13.2 percent.</p>

<p>“We must be more deliberate in our efforts to balance out the opportunities in the city,” said Oramenta Newsome, vice president for DC’s Local Initiatives Support Corp., a group targeting low-income neighborhoods, and a member of the plan’s advisory committee.</p>

<p>Metropolitan areas around the country have seen an influx of new residents seeking urban living, which boosts tax revenue but creates growing disparities in income and wealth accumulation, according to Peter Tatian of the Urban Institute.</p>

<p>“D.C. is certainly not immune from any of those things,” Tatian said.</p>

<p>The Urban Institute helped the city develop the economic growth indicators for the plan.</p>

<p>When the city’s leaders set out in 2000 to add 100,000 residents, they spent relatively little time thinking about the challenges that kind of growth might present, said Steve Glaude, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development.</p>

<p>They thought they were throwing a pebble into a pond, Glaude said.</p>

<p>D.C.’s population surged to 681,000 in 2016, up 109,000 since 2000. The city was almost a decade into its growth when leaders in government and nonprofits began focusing on the resulting economic disparity, Glaude said.</p>

<p>“The splash was bigger than anticipated,” he said.</p>

<p>Glaude said the mayor’s plan promotes a competitive economy and pairs it with efforts to reduce disparity.</p>

<p>The report stresses the need to move away from the city’s dependence on the federal sector, which buffered the Washington region during the most recent recession. Though the federal government accounts for an outsized share of the city’s GDP, federal-sector growth plateaued in recent years and is expected to decrease in the current political climate.</p>

<p>The mayor hopes that bolstering existing industries and cultivating growth-oriented sectors such as technology can offset and surpass any contraction of the federal government.</p>

<p>Prescribed changes to the permitting and licensing systems aim to help businesses open and operate more easily in the District. The plan also calls for legacy institutions such as universities and hospitals to increase their procurements with small and minority-owned businesses. The focus on new industries includes recommendations for workforce training for the jobs that will be created, such as solar installation.</p>

<p>Raj Aggarwal, chairman of a business advocacy group called Think Local First, said he was encouraged to see the government engage local businesses within the city rather than relying on tax subsidies to lure in outside companies. His organization of local independent businesses includes the likes of Busboys and Poets and local Ace Hardware stores.</p>

<p>Aggarwal credited the mayor for creating measurable goals that can help initiatives outlast possible changes in the political environment from the next mayoral election.</p>

<p>“What can we do to put down the roots now so it’s beyond an administration, but what’s best for the city?” he said.</p> -->
