The kickoff for the grant program is being held at <b>Google DC</b> today.</p>

<p>Organizations can submit proposals for a new project, or an expansion of an existing effort. The grants will be from $500-$10,000.</p>

<p>“This grant program seeks to accomplish two goals: Connect our local women-led organizations with one another to encourage community and knowledge, and find new, innovative ways to build and support female entrepreneurs in the district,” <b>Xina Eiland</b>, founder of X+PR and BEACON’s board member, said in a statement.</p>

<p>The grant program is the latest initiative from BEACON, which launched in November 2016 as partnership <b>Mayor Muriel Bowser, Google,</b> and the <b>Georgetown Law Institute for Technology Law and Policy.</b> A <a href="http://www.thebeacondc.com/">new website</a> debuted at SXSW that features a directory of women-owned businesses and organizations. The directory now has more than 200 listings.</p>

<p>BEACON has the goal of making D.C. “the most supportive ecosystem for women entrepreneurs in the United States,” and is one of a number of initiatives popping up in D.C. focusing around <a href="https://technical.ly/dc/2016/12/01/dc-inclusive-innovation-report/">inclusive innovation</a>.</p>
