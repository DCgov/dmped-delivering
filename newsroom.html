<p>The Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development (DMPED) is requesting input on the design of and approach to a new program anticipated for implementation within the next year. The project seeks to increase access to capital for DC entrepreneurs, and particularly for underrepresented entrepreneurs, such as people of color and women by creating an investment fund focused on early stage ventures. Comments on the technical aspects of program design and the work plan and suggestions on approaches to implementing an effective program are welcomed.</p>

<p>The purpose of this Request for Information (RFI) is to solicit input from investment professionals and DC’s entrepreneurial community on the investment capital needs, program design, and potential partnerships. Stakeholders responding to this RFI are asked to provide informed responses and feedback regarding the project overview below and describe any benefits, changes, limitations, unintended consequences, and potential economic gains or losses that may result from the project. In addition, respondents can provide recommendations (including proposed draft RFQ/RFP/RFA language) regarding the best approach for implementation and program design—specifically noting how the program would address the District’s objectives for the program.</p>

<p>Responses are due by 2 pm EST on Tuesday, March 6, 2018.</p>
