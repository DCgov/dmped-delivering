<p>When it rains hackathons, it pours hackathons. And that’s precisely the forecast for this weekend.</p>

<p>In addition to Women Who Code DC’s startup hackathon, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development and the Washington Post will be teaming up to host this year’s InnoMAYtion hackathon.</p>


<p>It’s the third year for Mayor Muriel Bowser’s monthlong initiative celebrating innovation in the District, and the third year for its eponymous hackathon, too. This year’s event will focus in on two of InnoMAYtion 2017’s four themes — namely women in STEM and entrepreneurship and youth in STEM and entrepreneurship, organizer Joy M. Whitt told Technical.ly.</p>

<p>Project tracks in the civic hackathon will focus on Think of Us, My Brother’s Keeper, Black Girl Vision, Code for DC’s Housing Insights project and more. There will be workshops on design and UX, intro to Python and intro to JavaScript, as well as a fireside chat with leaders from the women’s entrepreneurship initiative BEACON.</p>


<p>“I’m excited for this hackathon because we’ve created an opportunity for women and youth to both help and learn from other women and youth,” Whitt told Technical.ly. “We’ve got some incredible projects lined up, and I’m excited to see how they progress after a day of civic hacking.”</p>

<!-- <p>“We must be more deliberate in our efforts to balance out the opportunities in the city,” said Oramenta Newsome, vice president for DC’s Local Initiatives Support Corp., a group targeting low-income neighborhoods, and a member of the plan’s advisory committee.</p>

<p>Metropolitan areas around the country have seen an influx of new residents seeking urban living, which boosts tax revenue but creates growing disparities in income and wealth accumulation, according to Peter Tatian of the Urban Institute.</p>

<p>“D.C. is certainly not immune from any of those things,” Tatian said.</p>

<p>The Urban Institute helped the city develop the economic growth indicators for the plan.</p>

<p>When the city’s leaders set out in 2000 to add 100,000 residents, they spent relatively little time thinking about the challenges that kind of growth might present, said Steve Glaude, executive director of the nonprofit advocacy group Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development.</p>

<p>They thought they were throwing a pebble into a pond, Glaude said.</p>

<p>D.C.’s population surged to 681,000 in 2016, up 109,000 since 2000. The city was almost a decade into its growth when leaders in government and nonprofits began focusing on the resulting economic disparity, Glaude said.</p>

<p>“The splash was bigger than anticipated,” he said.</p>

<p>Glaude said the mayor’s plan promotes a competitive economy and pairs it with efforts to reduce disparity.</p>

<p>The report stresses the need to move away from the city’s dependence on the federal sector, which buffered the Washington region during the most recent recession. Though the federal government accounts for an outsized share of the city’s GDP, federal-sector growth plateaued in recent years and is expected to decrease in the current political climate.</p>

<p>The mayor hopes that bolstering existing industries and cultivating growth-oriented sectors such as technology can offset and surpass any contraction of the federal government.</p>

<p>Prescribed changes to the permitting and licensing systems aim to help businesses open and operate more easily in the District. The plan also calls for legacy institutions such as universities and hospitals to increase their procurements with small and minority-owned businesses. The focus on new industries includes recommendations for workforce training for the jobs that will be created, such as solar installation.</p>

<p>Raj Aggarwal, chairman of a business advocacy group called Think Local First, said he was encouraged to see the government engage local businesses within the city rather than relying on tax subsidies to lure in outside companies. His organization of local independent businesses includes the likes of Busboys and Poets and local Ace Hardware stores.</p>

<p>Aggarwal credited the mayor for creating measurable goals that can help initiatives outlast possible changes in the political environment from the next mayoral election.</p>

<p>“What can we do to put down the roots now so it’s beyond an administration, but what’s best for the city?” he said.</p> -->
