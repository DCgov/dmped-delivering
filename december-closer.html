<h1>Rounding Out Another Successful Year</h1>

<p>Phew, time flies when you’re busy delivering for the residents of the District of Columbia! Heading into the last month of 2017, we are taking a moment to look back on all that we accomplished this year.</p>

<p>We hosted our first ever DMPED cluster pilot Open House in January, where more than 500 residents came to learn about agency initiatives and meet-and-greet with directors; we held the Third Annual March Madness, where 20 development projects city-wide were introduced including three from DMPED; we highlighted our growing tech and innovation sector at  SXSW in Austin; curated a bigger, bolder innoMAYtion; opened the District Wharf at the Southwest Waterfront; submitted a bid for Amazon’s HQ2; created over 4,000 affordable housing units; and hosted countless groundbreakings and ribbon cuttings. We are seeing the fruits of our labor, but most importantly, it means we are serving DC residents!</p>

<p>And, our fall legislative package is moving along nicely! With <b>10</b> projects legislated, <b>990</b> affordable housing units ready in the pipeline, providing <b>19,000</b> construction and permanent jobs across the city, and an amazing <b>$2.3 Billion</b> in tax revenues expected over the next <b>30 years</b>, I would say we are on track for success!</p>

<p>We are excited to see what this next month can bring. So far, we invite you to accompany us in celebrating ribbon cutting ceremonies on two major redevelopments from our project pipeline. First, we are hosting a ribbon cutting ceremony with DC Public Library on December 9 at 10:30 a.m. at the new <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/west-end-library-ribbon-cutting-tickets-40881109499">West End Library</a> (2301 L St, NW). Second, we will cut the ribbon at the former site of <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ribbon-cutting-at-700-penn-and-770-c-st-se-former-hine-school-tickets-40109471509">Hine Junior High School</a> (700 Penn and 770 C St, SE) on Dec. 12 at 11:30 a.m. And stay tuned for DMPED’s 2018 Open House at the beginning of January!</p>

<p>We are excited to ring in 2018 with you all and wish you a safe, happy holiday season!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Brian T. Kenner</p>
