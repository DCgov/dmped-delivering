<h1>Welcome to the Wharf and Much More!</h1>

<p>Wow, what a September! We celebrated DC’s dynamic creative economy all month long for <a href ="http://www.202creates.com/">202Creates</a>, opened the first public building, <a href ="https://dmped.dc.gov/release/mayor-bowser-cuts-ribbon-dci-and-lamb-schools-walter-reed">DCI and LAMB Schools</a>, on the historic Walter Reed campus in Ward 4 and announced that DC would compete for <b>Amazon’s second headquarters</b> – (check out the Mayor’s video “<a href="http://www.alexawhydc.com/">Alexa Why DC?</a>”!)</p>

<p>But I have to admit, I’ve been looking forward to October – this month, the first phase of the <a href="https://www.wharfdc.com/">District’s Wharf</a> will open in Southwest. Over the last <b>200+ years</b>, the area went through periods of renewal and decline, but for the last 50 years it has been mostly untouched – until now.</p>

<p>Starting on October 12, visitors to the Wharf can enjoy <b>30 new restaurants and shops</b> and hear music at the new <b>6,000</b> capacity venue, the <a href="https://www.theanthemdc.com/">Anthem</a>, which will host Foo Fighters on opening night. Most importantly, the first phase of Wharf brings jobs and economic opportunity – with <b>1,150 construction jobs</b> and <b>2,100 permanent jobs</b>. The Wharf project represents one of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/realestate/commercial/waterfront-washington.html">best examples</a> of a public/private partnership to deliver a first-class waterfront development. I can’t wait to visit and hear what you think as well. View all the kick-off celebrations <a href="https://www.wharfdc.com/upcoming-events/2017-10-12-kickoff-celebration/">at this link</a>.</a></p>

<p>Also, during the first week of October, DMPED will also participate in Mayor Bowser’s Housing Week held in conjunction with National Community Development Week. We will kick off the events with a groundbreaking at RL Christian Library on Oct. 2, an all-new <b>32 unit</b> affordable housing development with ground floor retail. The event will also include announcements about the city’s affordable housing investments from the Mayor and Department of Housing and Community Development Director Polly Donaldson.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for more and see you at the Wharf! </p>

<p>I could go on and on previewing what is coming this fall, but for now, you will have to just stay tuned and make plans to join us along the way.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Brian T. Kenner</p>
