<h1>Open for You, DC</h1>

<p>As we close out this year, I’m excited to announce that we will <b>start</b> the year with <b>you</b> – our District residents and stakeholders – at our second annual <b>DC Economic Development Cluster Open House on Jan. 11</b>!</p>

<p>Last year, I hosted our first-ever open house of this kind featuring all the agencies of the DMPED cluster in the District of Columbia. Given we hadn’t done this before, we weren’t sure what to expect. But you all came out – and in big numbers. You told us it was valuable to meet cluster leadership and staff, learn about services and get your questions answered. For this year, we are working on <b>delivering an even better experience </b> for you with more opportunities for engagement, interaction and learning.</p>

<p>As I often tell my staff: “Public service is a privilege,” but we can’t do the work without your input. Please make plans to drop by and see us Jan. 11 anytime between 4-7 p.m. at the Convention Center. RSVP and view participating agencies and organizations <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/dc-economic-development-cluster-open-house-2018-tickets-41435343227">at this link</a>.</p>

<p>We are also excited to announce a <b>“topping off” celebration</b> for the new <b>Entertainment and Sports Arena</b> at St. Elizabeths East in January. This transformative project in Ward 8 will bring an estimated <b>380,000</b> new visitors per year to Congress Heights and approximately <b>$90 million</b> in new tax revenues over <b>20</b> years. You can also join us for this event also Jan. 11 by RSVP’ing <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/topping-out-celebration-for-the-new-entertainment-and-sports-arena-tickets-41342076263">at this link</a>.</p>

<p>We can’t <b>thank you</b> enough for being engaged in our economic development work for the District of Columbia. I hope to see you at the Open House on Jan. 11! </p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Deputy Mayor Brian T. Kenner</p>
